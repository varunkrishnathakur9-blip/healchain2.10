# - NDD-FE decryption: Functional and secure
# - Configuration: Centralized and consistent
# - Integration: 100% compatibility across all components
# 
# 🚫 DO NOT MODIFY:
# - No changes to cryptographic algorithms
# - No modifications to curve parameters
# - No updates to limits or constants
# - No alterations to serialization formats
# 
# 📝 MAINTENANCE:
# - Bug fixes only (with comprehensive testing)
# - Security patches (with full regression testing)
# - Performance optimizations (with validation)
# 
# 🎯 STATUS: PRODUCTION READY
# 📅 FROZEN: January 2026
